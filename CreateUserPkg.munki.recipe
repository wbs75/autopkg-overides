			<string>This utility creates packages that create local user accounts when installed.
The packages can create users on 10.5-10.8, and they are compatible with all workflows that can install standard installer pkgs.
Packages created using this utility encrypts the password as a salted SHA1 hash, which is how 10.5 and 10.6 normally stores it.

Using a dictionary based attack they are reasonably easy to crack on modern machines, so make sure you pick a good, strong password.
In 10.7 and up this is converted to PBKDF2 upon first login, which is much harder to crack, but the SHA1 hash can still be extracted from the package.

If you enable automatic login the password is stored in a kcpassword file, which is merely obfuscated and not encrypted - extracting the password (no matter how strong) is trivial.</string>
